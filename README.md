## Description
As a part of our statistical learning course, my team and I trained and tested a random forest model in combination with latent semantic analysis to predict the type of adverse event that occurs due to a medical device error using MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) data. We achieved a 2.51% misclassification error. This repo contains my contributions towards that project.

## Obtaining Data 
The data was obtained from the [FDA MAUDE database](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/mandatory-reporting-requirements-manufacturers-importers-and-device-user-facilities/about-manufacturer-and-user-facility-device-experience-maude).
